>## What is Crowdfunding?
> [Hivelr](https://www.hivelr.com/2020/12/what-is-crowdfunding/): Crowdfunding is a process of raising capital in small increments from many investors using an online platform. It is the most popular way for entrepreneurs to get money and launch their businesses. On the other hand, traditional financing like a bank loan requires collateral, credit check, and due diligence.

>## Raising funds on Blockchain - Use Cases:
> [Disruptordaily](https://www.disruptordaily.com/blockchain-use-cases-crowdfunding/): Crowdfunding has become an extremely useful alternative to venture capital, and has also allowed non-traditional projects, such as those started by in-need families or hopeful creatives, a new audience to pitch their cause. To date, $34 billion has been raised through crowdfunding initiatives, adding roughly $65 billion to the global economy. Kickstarter alone was responsible for over $600 million raised in 2017, a bounce back that falls in line with projections that show a possible $90 billion valuation for all crowdfunding sources by 2019, surpassing venture capital funding in the process.

Anyone who creates content on the Internet may want to consider attempting to sell their work as an NFT while the market is still booming.
