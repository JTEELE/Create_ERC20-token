>## What is Crowdfunding??
> [Hivelr](https://www.hivelr.com/2020/12/what-is-crowdfunding/): Crowdfunding is a process of raising capital in small increments from many investors using an online platform. It is the most popular way for entrepreneurs to get money and launch their businesses. On the other hand, traditional financing like a bank loan requires collateral, credit check, and due diligence.
